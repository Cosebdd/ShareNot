## Why ShareNot?
ShareNot is a customized version of [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX), specifically designed for corporate use to prevent data leakage. With ShareNot, you can safely capture screenshots and screen recordings without any risk of uploading data to external servers.

ShareNot is ideal for organizations that need to maintain strict control over their data, ensuring that all captured information remains within the company's secure environment.
